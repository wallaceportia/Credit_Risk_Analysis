# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

Fast Lending a peer to peer lending company has decided to use 'Machine Learning' to predict credit risk.  They would like to use Machine Learning as they believe it will provide a quicker and more reliable lending experience.  The idea is that it would lead to choosing good candidates for loans and in turn lower default rates. In conjunction with the lead Data Scientist, Jill, we will build several machine learning algorithms to predict credit risk. The resampling techinque wil be Oversampling, Undersampling, Combinatorial and Ensemble Classifiers. The 6 techniques that will be used are:

*A.Oversampling*

   1.Naive Random Oversampling

   2.Smote

*B.Undersampling*

   3. ClusterCentroids

*C. Combinatorial*

   4.Smoteenn

*D.Ensemble Classifiers*

   5.RandomForest
  
   6.AdaBoosting
  
 Based on the following results we will choose which of these models may be the most viable to implement  
	
## Results:

###### 1. Naive Random Oversampling

a.Accuracy Score
        
![Naive_Oversampling](https://github.com/wallaceportia/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/main/Resources_pictures/naive%20random%20accuracy.PNG)
	
The accuracy score for predicting high risk loan is 0.655 or 66%. This model is not demonstrative of a highly accurate model. It is still useful as         it is the easiest classification metric to understand however it does not reveal the underlying disribution of respone values.
	
![Naive Precision](https://github.com/wallaceportia/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/main/Resources_pictures/naive%20random%20classification.PNG)

b.Precision Score
	
The precision score for this model high risk loans is .01 or 1% and the precision for low risk loans is 1.00



c.Recall Score

The recall score for high risk loan is .68 or 68% and the sensitivity for low risk loans is .63 or 63% 
	

###### 2. Smote

## Summary:

A pronounced implance between the sensitivity and precision will yield a low F1 score
o	There is a summary of the results (2 pt)
o	There is a recommendation on which model to use, or there is no recommendation with a justification (3 pt)
