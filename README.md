# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

Fast Lending a peer to peer lending company has decided to use 'Machine Learning' to predict credit risk.  They would like to use Machine Learning as they believe it will provide a quicker and more reliable lending experience.  The idea is that it would lead to choosing good candidates for loans and in turn lower default rates. In conjunction with the lead Data Scientist, Jill, we will build several machine learning algorithms to predict credit risk. The resampling techinque wil be Oversampling, Undersampling, Combinatorial and Ensemble Classifiers. The 6 techniques that will be used are:

*A.	Oversampling*

      1.	Naive Random Oversampling

      2.	Smote

*B.	Undersampling*

      3.  ClusterCentroids

*C. Combinatorial*

      4.	Smoteenn

*D.	Ensemble Classifiers*

      5.	Randomforest
  
      6.	AdaBoosting
  
 Based on the following results we will choose which of these models may be the most viable to implement
